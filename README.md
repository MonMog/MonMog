# Background

I'm a computer engineering student, planning to graduate in early 2027 with a concentration in robotics. I am a passionate and eager learner with a deep interest in programming, computer science, and machine learning / AI. Additionally, I enjoy exploring the physical aspects of programming, such as working with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis. If I don't know much about a topic and I don't have a lot of time, I will be spending most of my time learning and understanding about it.
