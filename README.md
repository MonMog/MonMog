# Background

I'm a computer engineering student, planning to graduate in early 2027 with a concentration in robotics. I’m driven by my passion for learning. I enjoy delving into programming, with a strong curiosity for both software and hardware. I also enjoy hands-on work with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis. When I take on a new topic, I’m fully committed to diving deep and making sure I understand the ins and outs of it.
